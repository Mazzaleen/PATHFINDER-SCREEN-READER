First checkin TODO:
-ways command

GDPR information:
-general data protection regulation
-personal data: name, contact details, location, race, sexual orientation
-must need consent to keep personal information
-without consent, companies must delete personal information
-up to 4% of annual revenue as a penalty for not complying

Questions:
-what requirements imposed: must get consent for all the information used (name, location, etc), must delete data if
there is no consent or if somebody requests it
-hard or easy: this shouldn't be too hard, just add a delete function and ask for consent beforehand
-other situations: yes! if you have a large database, social media site, etc and have to retroactively go through
and do this after the law is passed

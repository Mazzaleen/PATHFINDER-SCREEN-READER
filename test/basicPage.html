article html: It would take about 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 lions, massed together in one massive ball
to outweigh the sun, thus (theoretically) defeating it. The over all mass of our Lion Star would be 2.664e28 kg,
while the sun is only about 1.989e30 kg.

    Paragraph html: So, lets create a theoretical scenario, lets say that our Lion Star is sent on a collision course
    to the sun from some undefined location, traveling at the speed of light (as I said, I have to go soon, so we're
    going to pretend the sun is stationary). Once LS collides with our Sun it would result in a whopping 7.9 Joules and
    have a momentum of 5.359162080815687e55 kg m/s and the collision would cause our Sun to go hurdling off in the
    opposite direction at the velocity of 295,830,207.26022506 kph. To put this into perspective, the Sun gives off
    3.826e26 Joules of energy a second. So we would undoubtedly be destroyed. I've never been very good at Physics,
    and I've only taken a high school level class, so these answers are very likely to be wrong and have many errors,
    but I have to go, if anyone has better info I would LOVE to hear it, I've become very curious about this. :)
